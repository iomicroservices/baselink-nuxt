## Our history

BaseLink was founded in 2022 with a clear goal: to make property services simpler, smarter, and more connected. The name says it all â€” *"base"* represents your home, business, or property, while *"link"* reflects our mission to bring everything you need together in one place.

We started by listening to the frustrations people had with unreliable service providers, outdated booking systems, and a lack of transparency. BaseLink was built to solve that â€” using technology to streamline the process and put control back in the hands of customers.
