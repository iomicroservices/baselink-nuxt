#### **4.2 International Transfers**
We aim to keep your personal data within the **UK and EEA** wherever possible. However, some of our third-party providers may process data in other countries, including the **United States**.

Where your data is transferred outside of the UK or EEA, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your privacy rights. These safeguards may include:

We only transfer personal data internationally when necessary and always ensure that your data is protected to the same standard required under UK and EU data protection laws.


### 5. How Long We Keep Your Data
We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide our services, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

The specific retention period depends on a number of factors, such as:
- The type and sensitivity of the data
- The nature of our relationship with you
- Legal, tax, and regulatory obligations
- Our need to defend or establish legal claims
- The operational and administrative needs of our business
- The level of risk associated with retaining or deleting the data (e.g. risk of fraud, unauthorised access, or harm)

We regularly review the personal data we hold and assess whether it is still necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy. Where retention is no longer necessary, we securely delete or anonymise your data. If you close your account, we will delete or anonymise your profile and restrict access to your data where possible. However, we may retain certain information where required for legal, regulatory, or legitimate business purposes. Where retention is no longer necessary, we securely delete or anonymise your data.

In some circumstances, you may have the right to request the deletion of your personal data (see Section 7: Your Rights). Please note that we may need to retain certain data even after a deletion request where we have a lawful reason to do so.

We may retain anonymised or aggregated data (which does not identify you) for analytics, research, or business reporting purposes indefinitely.
