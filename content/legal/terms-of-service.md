### 3. BaseLink Services Platform

#### **3.1 Role and Scope**
**3.1.1** BaseLink, operated by Mohana Ltd, provides an online platform that enables Users to request and book Services from self-employed Service Providers.<br>
**3.1.2** We act as a booking agency on behalf of self-employed Service Providers only. This means that when You make a Booking, You enter into two separate agreements: one with Us for the use of the Website, and one with the Service Provider for the provision of Services.<br>
**3.1.3** We are not the employer of any Service Provider, nor do We directly provide the Services listed on the Website.

#### **3.2 Service Provider Vetting**
**3.2.1** We take reasonable steps to vet all Service Providers before they are permitted to join the platform. This includes interviews and background checks carried out by Us or by third-party providers on Our behalf.<br>
**3.2.2** While We make efforts to ensure the suitability of Service Providers, We cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any background, identity, qualification, or criminal record checks performed by third parties.<br>
**3.2.3** By using the Services, You acknowledge that We do not warrant the reliability, safety, or performance of any Service Provider beyond the reasonable checks conducted during the onboarding process.

#### **3.3 Contract Formation**
**3.3.1** By placing a Booking, You confirm that You are at least 18 years of age and legally capable of entering into binding contracts.<br>
**3.3.2** All Bookings are subject to acceptance by Us. A legally binding contract is formed when We send You a written confirmation (a "Service Confirmation") via email.<br>
**3.3.3** At this point, two contracts come into existence: one between You and Us for the use of the platform, and one between You and the Service Provider for the provision of the Services.<br>
**3.3.4** You agree not to attempt to engage, solicit, or book any Service Provider introduced through Our platform other than via Us, for the duration of this agreement and for a period of three (3) months after the last Service has been provided under this agreement.

#### **3.4 Your Responsibilities**
**3.4.1** You are responsible for supervising the Service Provider while Services are being performed.<br>
**3.4.2** You must provide a safe, appropriate, and lawful environment for the delivery of the Services.<br>
**3.4.3** You accept that the use of Service Providers is at Your own risk and that We are not liable for the performance or conduct of any Service Provider.<br>
**3.4.4** We strongly recommend that You maintain adequate home or contents insurance to cover any potential loss or damage that may arise in connection with the Services booked through Our Website. While Service Providers are expected to exercise reasonable care, neither We nor the Service Providers can guarantee protection against all risks.

#### **3.5 Liability**
**3.5.1** We are not liable for any loss, damage, or injury caused by a Service Provider. This includes, but is not limited to, damage to property, personal injury, loss of business, income, or data, or any indirect or consequential losses.<br>
**3.5.2** We shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from unforeseen events or matters beyond Our reasonable control.

#### **3.6 Disputes**
**3.6.1** We may, at Our discretion, offer to mediate disputes between You and a Service Provider.<br>
**3.6.2** While We aim to assist in resolving issues, We make no guarantees as to the effectiveness or outcome of any mediation process.<br>
**3.6.3** Any complaints should be reported to Us as soon as possible and in any case within 72 hours of the issue arising.

#### **3.7 Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
**3.7.1** All contracts formed via the Website, are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.<br>
**3.7.2** Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England.

### 4. Pricing and Billing
#### **4.1 Prices, Quotes and Estimates**
**4.1.1** All prices displayed on the Website are inclusive of the Service Provider’s consideration and Our platform fees, and are based on the information provided by You at the time of Booking.<br>
**4.1.2** The final price may vary if the scope of the Service changes, additional time is required, or other reasonable adjustments are made. We will inform You as soon as practicable of any change in cost.<br>
**4.1.3** By proceeding with a Booking, You agree to pay the quoted price, subject to any permitted adjustments under these Terms. The price to be paid is the price quoted at the time of Booking, except in cases of obvious error or abuse of the Website or its pricing system.<br>
**4.1.4** We may change Our pricing at any time, but such changes will not affect Bookings that have already been accepted and confirmed by way of a Service Confirmation email.

#### **4.2 Pre-Authorisation and Payment Timing**
**4.2.1** You authorise Us to perform a pre-authorisation on Your chosen payment method or charge a deposit on the day Your Booking is made. This does not constitute acceptance of Your Booking until a Service Confirmation is issued.<br>
**4.2.2** The full amount will be charged on or after the day the Service is delivered, unless otherwise stated or agreed.<br>
**4.2.3** You authorise Us to charge Your payment method for all agreed amounts, including any additional charges incurred due to changes to the Service.

#### **4.3 Subscriptions and Recurring Payments**
**4.3.1** Certain Services may be offered on a subscription basis with recurring payments.<br>
**4.3.2** Subscription details, including frequency and pricing, will be clearly displayed at the time of Booking.<br>
**4.3.3** You may cancel a subscription in accordance with Our cancellation policy, provided notice is given as required.

#### **4.4 Promotions and Discounts**
**4.4.1** We may offer promotional discounts, credits, special pricing or limited-time offers at Our discretion. Such offers are made in order to promote Our business as a booking agent and may be withdrawn at any time without notice.<br>
**4.4.2** Promotional codes may only be used once per household, are non-transferable, and may not be applied retrospectively or in combination with other offers.<br>
**4.4.3** Promotional offers do not reduce the consideration payable to the Service Provider. Where applicable, We may subsidise the difference between the promotional amount paid by the Customer and the standard rate agreed with the Service Provider. This does not affect the Service Provider’s independent status or their responsibility for delivering the Service.<br>
**4.4.4** The Customer acknowledges that any amount paid under a promotional offer, up to the standard rate otherwise due for the Service, constitutes consideration payable to the Service Provider, and that BaseLink acts solely as a payment collection agent on their behalf in respect of that portion.

#### **4.5 Referral Scheme**
**4.5.1** We may offer a referral scheme that allows registered Users to refer others to the Website in exchange for credit, discounts, or other rewards.<br>
**4.5.2** Referral rewards will only be granted once the referred party has completed a qualifying Booking in accordance with the scheme’s published terms.<br>
**4.5.3** Referral links and codes must be used in a personal and non-commercial capacity.<br>
**4.5.4** Abuse of the referral scheme, including self-referral, bulk distribution, or use via paid advertising, is prohibited and may result in cancellation of rewards and/or suspension of Your Account.

#### **4.6 Failed Payments**
**4.6.1** You are responsible for ensuring that Your payment method is valid and has sufficient funds available on the due date.<br>
**4.6.2** If Your payment fails or is declined and is not settled within 24 hours, You agree to pay a late payment fee of £10 or 10% of the outstanding amount, whichever is greater, as a reasonable estimate of the administrative costs incurred by Us.<br>
**4.6.3** In addition, We reserve the right to charge statutory interest on the overdue amount at a rate of 8% per annum above the Bank of England base rate, calculated on a daily basis and charged at the end of each calendar month, from the due date until payment is received in full, in accordance with applicable UK law.<br>
**4.6.4** If We are required to initiate formal debt recovery proceedings, You may also be liable for any additional reasonable costs incurred in connection with the recovery of the debt, including solicitors’ fees, court fees, and enforcement costs, as permitted by law.<br>
**4.6.5** We will notify You in writing before commencing any recovery action and provide a reasonable opportunity for You to remedy the failure to pay.

#### **4.7 Payment Processing**
**4.7.1** Payments are processed by a third-party payment provider. By using the Website, You agree to comply with the payment provider’s terms and privacy policy.<br>
**4.7.2** We are not liable for delays, failures, or errors caused by the third-party provider, except to the extent required by law.

**5.1.1** We reserve the right to cancel any Booking or terminate Your access to the Website and Services at any time, with or without notice, and for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to the unavailability of a Service Provider, scheduling or pricing errors, safety concerns, or suspected breach of these Terms.<br>

**5.2.3** If the Service Provider attends the property at the scheduled time but is unable to gain access, or is otherwise prevented from provisioning the Service, this will be treated as a cancellation without notice. In such cases, We reserve the right to charge up to 100% of the Booking value or quoted amount.<br>
