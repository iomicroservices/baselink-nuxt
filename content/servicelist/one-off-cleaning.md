Your business calls just got smarter and less annoying. With our Blocklist service, wave goodbye to interruptions from unwanted callers, ensuring you and your team focus on the calls that truly matter.

### Anonymous Call Rejection (ACR)

Tired of picking up calls only to meet another automated message or a sales pitch you didn't sign up for? Our ACR service has got you covered.

- **Say No to Unknowns**: Block calls from hidden or anonymous numbers, letting you concentrate on genuine business interactions.
- **Stay in Control**: Decide which of your eLandline numbers has ACR activated. Tailor it to suit your business needs.
- **Instant Peace of Mind**: Enable or disable ACR instantly from your online control panel. No waiting, no hassle.
- **Clear Message**: Callers with withheld numbers will hear, "The person you are calling is not accepting anonymous calls. Please redial without withholding your number." No more guessing for your callers.

### Blacklist

With the Blacklist feature, take the reins of your call flow by blocking specific numbers, entire country codes, or ranges of numbers notorious for spam or unwanted calls.

- **Personalized Blocking**: From that persistent sales call to international spam numbers, blacklist them and keep your line clean.
- **Flexible and Customizable**: Use our online control panel to effortlessly manage your blacklist. Add or remove numbers as your needs evolve.
