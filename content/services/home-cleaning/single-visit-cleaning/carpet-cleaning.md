Book carpet cleaning{{$doc.location}} for a fresher floor

#description
Carpets can trap dirt, allergens, and odours over time — and regular vacuuming often isn’t enough. With BaseLink, you can book trusted local specialists{{$doc.location}} for deep carpet cleaning that lifts stains, freshens fibres and leaves your home looking and feeling cleaner.

#description
Every appointment starts with a full inspection of your carpets to check their condition, fabric type and any specific stains. The cleaner will vacuum to remove loose dirt and debris, then apply targeted pre-treatments to tackle marks and problem areas.

#description
Depending on the material, your carpet will be steam cleaned or dry cleaned using professional-grade equipment. Deep steam extraction helps remove ingrained dirt, while dry methods are ideal for delicate fibres or areas that need faster drying.

#description
To finish, a deodorising treatment is applied to remove lingering smells and leave your carpets fresh. If needed, air movers are used to speed up drying, so you can get back to enjoying your space sooner.

#description
You can customise your clean with specific instructions or additional rooms, and bundle carpet cleaning with other home services through BaseLink. Everything is handled online — just submit your request, get an instant quote, and choose a time that suits you.

#description
All providers on our platform are experienced, vetted, and reviewed by customers in your area. You’ll also be supported by our dedicated team throughout the process, so you’re never left chasing updates or confirmations.

#description
Payment is collected on the day of your clean, with any additional time billed fairly in 30-minute increments. It’s a transparent, hassle-free way to restore your carpets without lifting a finger.
