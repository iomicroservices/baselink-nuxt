Book upholstery cleaning{{$doc.location}} to refresh your home

#description
Furniture and soft furnishings can trap dust, allergens and odours over time — but with BaseLink, giving them a deep clean is easy. We connect you with trusted local professionals{{$doc.location}} who offer expert upholstery cleaning using specialist equipment and techniques tailored to your fabric.

#description
The service begins with a pre-inspection to assess the condition of your items. From sofas and armchairs to curtains and mattresses, your cleaner will check for stains, wear, and fabric sensitivity before choosing the most suitable cleaning method.

#description
Loose dirt is removed with a thorough vacuum, followed by pre-treatment and stain removal where needed. If suitable for the fabric, deep steam cleaning is used to lift embedded grime and bacteria from the fibres, leaving them fresh and restored.

#description
A deodorising treatment is applied to neutralise odours caused by pets, spills or everyday use. Air movers can also be used to reduce drying times, so your furniture is ready to enjoy again as soon as possible.
