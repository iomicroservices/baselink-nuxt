  - label: "What does upholstery cleaning include?"
    content: "We clean sofas, armchairs, dining chairs, mattresses, curtains and more. The service includes a fabric inspection, vacuuming, stain pre-treatment, steam or dry cleaning (depending on material), deodorising, and fast drying using air movers where needed."
    icon: mdi:sofa-outline

  - label: "Is steam cleaning safe for all fabrics?"
    content: "Not all. We inspect your upholstery first to decide the best method — steam cleaning for durable materials, or dry/low-moisture techniques for delicate fabrics. We always choose the safest approach for your furniture."
    icon: mdi:shield-check-outline

  - label: "Can you remove tough stains and smells?"
    content: "We treat common stains like food, drink, pet marks and ink using professional pre-treatment products. While most stains lift well, deep-set or old marks may only partially improve. We also apply a deodorising treatment to remove odours from pets, smoke, or spills."
    icon: mdi:nose

  - label: "How long does upholstery cleaning take?"
    content: "Most appointments take 1–3 hours depending on the number and type of items. We’ll estimate the time during booking and keep you updated throughout."
    icon: mdi:timer-outline

  - label: "How long will it take for my upholstery to dry?"
    content: "Drying times vary by fabric and airflow, but usually range from 2 to 6 hours. We use air movers where needed to help speed things up so you can get back to using your furniture sooner."
    icon: mdi:weather-windy

  - label: "Do I need to do anything before the cleaner arrives?"
    content: "Just remove any throws, cushions, or personal items from the furniture. If your item has fragile legs or special instructions, leave a note when booking so we can prepare accordingly."
    icon: mdi:note-edit-outline

  - label: "Can I book upholstery cleaning on its own?"
    content: "Yes — you can book it as a standalone service or combine it with other cleaning options like carpets or deep cleaning. Just select what you need during booking or add notes for special requests."
    icon: mdi:playlist-plus

  - label: "How do I book upholstery cleaning?"
    content: "It’s simple — fill in our online form, select the furniture you want cleaned, and get an instant quote. You’ll pick a time that works for you, and everything is handled through your BaseLink account."

Book upholstery cleaning{{$doc.location}} to refresh your home

#description
Furniture and soft furnishings can trap dust, allergens and odours over time — but with BaseLink, giving them a deep clean is easy. We connect you with trusted local professionals{{$doc.location}} who offer expert upholstery cleaning using specialist equipment and techniques tailored to your fabric.

#description
The service begins with a pre-inspection to assess the condition of your items. From sofas and armchairs to curtains and mattresses, your cleaner will check for stains, wear, and fabric sensitivity before choosing the most suitable cleaning method.

#description
Loose dirt is removed with a thorough vacuum, followed by pre-treatment and stain removal where needed. If suitable for the fabric, deep steam cleaning is used to lift embedded grime and bacteria from the fibres, leaving them fresh and restored.

#description
A deodorising treatment is applied to neutralise odours caused by pets, spills or everyday use. Air movers can also be used to reduce drying times, so your furniture is ready to enjoy again as soon as possible.
