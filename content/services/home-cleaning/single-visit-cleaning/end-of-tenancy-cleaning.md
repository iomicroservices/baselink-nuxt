Moving out? BaseLink connects you with trusted local cleaners{{$doc.location}} who specialise in end of tenancy cleaning — designed to meet the expectations of landlords, letting agents, and inventory clerks. Whether you’re a tenant, landlord or property manager, we make sure the property is left clean, fresh and ready for its next chapter.

#description
This deep, detailed clean covers every room in the home. Surfaces are dusted and wiped, floors are vacuumed and mopped, and all bathrooms and kitchens are scrubbed, sanitised and descaled. Taps, sinks, toilets and tiles are restored to a spotless finish.

High-touch surfaces are sanitised, and bins are emptied with rubbish and recycling cleared as part of the service. You can also add custom instructions — such as including a garage, utility room or focusing on a particular area — directly when booking.
