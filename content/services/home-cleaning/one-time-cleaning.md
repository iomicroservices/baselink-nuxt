  - label: "What is included in a one-time clean?"
    content: "One-time cleaning includes a full home refresh — deep cleaning, after builders cleaning, end of tenancy cleaning and carpet or upholstery deep cleaning. You can also add extras like laundry, linen changes, balcony sweeping, or custom tasks when booking."
    icon: mdi:home-outline

  - label: "How is this different from a regular cleaning service?"
    content: "It’s a non-recurring, one-off clean — perfect for special occasions, post-guests, or a general refresh. There’s no commitment, no schedule, and no follow-up bookings unless you want one later."
    icon: mdi:calendar-remove-outline

  - label: "Can I customise the tasks for my clean?"
    content: "Yes — you’re in full control. Use the quote form to select specific tasks or leave custom instructions. We’ll tailor the visit to match your home’s needs and your preferences."
    icon: mdi:clipboard-edit-outline

  - label: "How long does a one-time clean take?"
    content: "It depends on your home size and task list, but most one-time cleans take between 2 to 4 hours. You’ll receive a time recommendation when booking, and any extra time is billed in 30-minute increments if needed."
    icon: mdi:timer-sand

  - label: "Can I book a one-time clean on short notice?"
    content: "Yes — we offer same-day or next-day availability in most areas. Just fill out the booking form and we’ll match you with a trusted local cleaner as soon as possible."
    icon: mdi:clock-fast

  - label: "Do I need to be home during the clean?"
    content: "No — you can provide access instructions during booking. We offer flexible options like key drops, lockbox codes or key handover, so you don’t need to be there if you’d rather not."
    icon: mdi:account-off-outline

  - label: "What equipment or products do I need to provide?"
    content: "Please provide a hoover, mop, and bucket. You can also supply your own cleaning products, or we can bring eco-friendly supplies for a small additional fee. Just let us know what you prefer when booking."
    icon: mdi:spray-bottle

  - label: "How do I book a one-time cleaning?"
    content: "Just fill out our quick online form, select your tasks, and get an instant quote. Pick a time that suits you — and we’ll take care of the rest, all managed through your BaseLink account."
    icon: mdi:calendar-check-outline

  - label: "How is pricing handled?"
    content: "You’ll see a clear hourly rate when booking. Payment is collected on the day of service, and if extra time is needed, we’ll bill in fair 30-minute increments. Everything is transparent and itemised."
    icon: mdi:receipt-text-outline

  - label: "Are your cleaners vetted and insured?"
    content: "Yes — all BaseLink cleaners are fully insured, background-checked, and reviewed after every job. We only work with professionals who meet our standards for safety and quality."
