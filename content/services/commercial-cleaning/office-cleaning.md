From workstations to washrooms, we help keep your office spotless, organised, and ready for whatever the day brings.

Every clean is tailored to your space. Surfaces are dusted, floors vacuumed and mopped, and high-touch areas thoroughly sanitised. Kitchens are cleaned, the dishwasher is run if needed, and bathrooms are restocked and refreshed. We also take care of trash removal and ensure everything feels fresh when your team arrives in the morning.

Breakout spaces and meeting rooms are cleaned and tidied, and workstations are wiped down and kept organised. Your cleaner can also restock office supplies and toiletries, making it easier to stay on top of daily essentials. Mirrors, cabinets and shared appliances are included too — because the details matter.
