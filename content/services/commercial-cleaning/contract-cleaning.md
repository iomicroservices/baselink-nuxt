Our contract cleaning services cover all the essentials — from dusting, vacuuming and mopping to sanitising high-touch surfaces and restocking supplies. Kitchens and bathrooms are cleaned thoroughly, bins are emptied, and surfaces are wiped down to keep your workspaces hygienic and welcoming.

Workstations, common areas and breakout spaces are given extra attention to ensure a clean and tidy environment throughout. We also take care of appliances, cabinet fronts, interior windows and mirrors, so the space looks polished from every angle.

#description
Through BaseLink, you can customise your regular cleaning schedule with tasks like linen replacement, dishwasher use, or restocking toiletries and consumables. You'll also get a checklist to monitor supplies — and your cleaner can help you stay on top of what needs to be refilled.
