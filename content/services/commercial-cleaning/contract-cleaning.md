Contract cleaning{{$doc.location}} that fits your schedule

#description
BaseLink connects you with trusted local cleaners who specialise in contract cleaning{{$doc.location}} for offices, commercial premises and shared buildings. Whether you need daily, weekly or fortnightly visits, our flexible scheduling and digital booking platform makes it easy to keep your space consistently clean and presentable.

#description
Our contract cleaning services cover all the essentials — from dusting, vacuuming and mopping to sanitising high-touch surfaces and restocking supplies. Kitchens and bathrooms are cleaned thoroughly, bins are emptied, and surfaces are wiped down to keep your workspaces hygienic and welcoming.

#description
Workstations, common areas and breakout spaces are given extra attention to ensure a clean and tidy environment throughout. We also take care of appliances, cabinet fronts, interior windows and mirrors, so the space looks polished from every angle.

#description
Through BaseLink, you can customise your regular cleaning schedule with tasks like linen replacement, dishwasher use, or restocking toiletries and consumables. You’ll also get a checklist to monitor supplies — and your cleaner can help you stay on top of what needs to be refilled.

#description
Booking and managing your cleaning through BaseLink is simple. You’ll receive an instant quote when you submit your form, and you can set your preferred dates and frequency using our user-friendly digital platform. It’s designed to save time, reduce admin, and keep everything in one place.

#description
Unlike many traditional cleaning companies, we give you the freedom to customise your plan, manage special requests, and stay informed every step of the way. You’ll be supported by our dedicated team, and any additional time is charged fairly in 30-minute increments after the clean.

#description
With BaseLink, you get more than a cleaner — you get a smart, flexible way to manage your ongoing cleaning needs. Whether you’re responsible for a single office or multiple locations, we help you stay on top of it all with ease and confidence.
