Keeping your business, rental, or shared spaces clean has never been easier. BaseLink connects you with trusted, local cleaning professionals who are experienced in all types of commercial cleaning. Whether you're managing an office, running a short-let property, or looking after a residential block, weâ€™ll help you find the right cleaner for the job.

#description
Our commercial cleaning service covers a wide range of spaces. From quick changeovers in Airbnb and holiday rentals to routine contract cleaning, we match you with professionals who understand the importance of consistency, quality, and timeliness. Offices, serviced apartments, and communal areas in residential buildings are all part of the service. Whether itâ€™s a one-off deep clean or a recurring schedule, itâ€™s all flexible and designed around your needs.

#description
Booking a cleaner through BaseLink is simple and efficient. Just fill out our online form, and youâ€™ll receive an instant quote based on the property type and service required. From there, you can choose a time that suits you. Whether itâ€™s a last-minute turnaround or a regular weekly slot, you stay in control of the schedule.

#description
You can also customise your service to include any specific requirements. Need inside window cleaning, kitchen appliance attention, or restocking supplies? Just let us know. The cleaners we connect you with bring all the right tools and experience to keep your space spotless and ready for use.

#description
At BaseLink, we aim to be a reliable partner for property managers, business owners, and landlords alike. We only work with vetted, well-reviewed professionals to ensure every visit meets high standards. And because weâ€™re a platform, you always have support from our team if you need to make changes or ask a question.

#description
Payment is simple too. It's collected on the day of the clean, with the base rate agreed in advance. If any extra time is required, itâ€™s charged in fair 30-minute increments after the visit, so you only pay for what you use.

#description
Whether you're juggling multiple properties or just want a fresh, professional clean, we make the process easy from start to finish. With transparent pricing, local professionals, and a booking system that fits around your schedule, BaseLink helps you get on with your day â€” while we take care of the cleaning.
