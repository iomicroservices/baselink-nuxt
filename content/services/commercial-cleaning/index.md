  - label: "How do I get a quote for my business?"
    content: "You can easily get a bespoke quote by filling out our online form. Just tell us your property type, the services you need, and how often you'd like cleaning. We'll be in touch within one working day with your tailored quote â€” and follow it up with a quick call to chat through everything. There's no contract to lock you in. Change or cancel cleans anytime with 24 hours' notice, no fees. The more we work together, the better your rates and terms get. Fair and flexible â€” just how it should be."

  - label: "Are your cleaners insured and vetted?"
    content: "Yes! All our cleaners are fully insured and carefully vetted through interviews, background checks, and customer reviews to ensure consistently high quality. We'll match you with cleaners from your local area who are paid above the local living wage (because good people deserve it). We've built a platform that's easy and rewarding to work on, so you get the best people, every time."
    icon: mdi:shield-check-outline

  - label: "Can I book cleaning outside of regular business hours?"
    content: "Yes! We understand businesses have unique schedules. You can book early morning, evening, or weekend cleaning to avoid disrupting your workflow. Just let us know what works best for you when filling out the online quote form."
    icon: mdi:clock-time-four-outline

  - label: "What's included in your commercial cleaning service?"
    content: "Our service includes everything from dusting and vacuuming to sanitising high-touch surfaces, trash removal, and kitchen cleaning. We can also handle specific tasks like window cleaning, floor care, and restocking supplies, all tailored to your needs. If you have specific requirements not covered in the quote form, just include it in the 'Anything else we should know?' section. You can add any specific instructions or requests, whether it's extra cleaning in high-traffic areas or a focus on deep cleaning particular zones like restrooms or break-out spaces."
    icon: mdi:playlist-check

  - label: "Do I need to provide cleaning supplies or equipment?"
    content: "You'll need to provide a hoover, mop, and bucket. We can bring our own eco-friendly cleaning products for a small fee, or you're welcome to provide your own â€” just make sure the right supplies are available on the day. If you're using your own products, double-check they're suitable â€” we can't be responsible for any mishaps from the wrong stuff."
    icon: mdi:shopping-outline

  - label: "Can I request one-off cleaning tasks?"
    content: "Absolutely! You're free to book one-off cleans anytime â€” with or without a regular schedule. Whether it's a single deep clean or an extra visit on top of your regular service, you can manage it all through your online account. No contracts, no pressure â€” just clean when you need it."
    icon: mdi:clipboard-edit-outline

  - label: "What if I need to change or cancel my booking?"
    content: "No problem! You can reschedule or cancel your clean with 24 hours' notice at no extra charge. We want the process to be as flexible and stress-free as possible."
    icon: mdi:cancel-outline

  - label: "Will I have the same cleaner every time?"
    content: "Yes â€” once you're onboarded, we assign a dedicated cleaner or cleaning team to your site for every visit. We source experienced professionals locally to ensure reliability and consistency. If you ever have concerns or need a change, just let us know â€” we're happy to reassign and make it right."
    icon: mdi:account-check-outline

  - label: "Do your cleaners wear uniforms?"
    content: "All our commercial cleaners wear professional uniforms by default, making them easy to identify on-site. If you'd prefer them to wear your company's uniform instead, that's no problem. Just let us know during onboarding and provide at least two full sets per cleaner, free of charge. We ask that replacements are also supplied to cover normal wear and tear, so your team always looks the part."
    icon: mdi:tshirt-crew-outline

  - label: "Do your cleaners carry ID?"
    content: "Cleaners have their official BaseLink photo ID available in their app, which they can show on arrival. If your site requires additional ID, such as visitor badges or branded passes, you're welcome to supply them. Just let us know what's needed, and we'll make sure it's worn on-site."
    icon: mdi:card-account-details-outline

  - label: "How many cleaners will you send?"
    content: "It depends on your site size and cleaning needs. For smaller offices, one regular cleaner may be enough. For larger sites, we'll assign a team to cover the job efficiently. We always try to match you with local cleaners for consistency and reliability. Need cleaners for multiple sites? We can accommodate that too."
    icon: mdi:account-group-outline

  - label: "What happens if my regular cleaner is off sick or on holiday?"
    content: "We do our best to assign you the same cleaner or team each time, but if someone's away, we've got you covered. We'll send a fully briefed, trained cover cleaner to keep your service running smoothly â€” no disruption, no drop in quality."
    icon: mdi:calendar-refresh-outline

  - label: "How do you handle access to the property?"
    content: "We're flexible â€” whether you use key cards, access codes, a site manager sign-in or secure key storage, we'll work with your setup. Our team follows clear access instructions, and we ensure any keys or codes are stored and used securely. Want to use a dedicated key safe or keyholder policy? Just let us know."
    icon: mdi:key-outline

  - label: "Can I book for multiple locations?"
    content: "If you manage multiple sites, we've got you covered. During onboarding, you can set up each location in your online account, complete with its own cleaning schedule and preferences. Whether it's one site or ten, we'll coordinate everything to run smoothly â€” all under one account."
