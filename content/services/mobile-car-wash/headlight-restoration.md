  - label: "Why should I restore my headlights?"
    content: "Cloudy or yellowed headlights reduce night-time visibility and can even cause MOT failure. Restoring them improves safety, refreshes your car’s look, and helps avoid the cost of full headlight replacements."
    icon: mdi:alert-circle-outline

  - label: "Is this service safe for all types of headlights?"
    content: "Yes — our technicians use products and tools suitable for all common headlight lens materials, including plastic and polycarbonate. If your vehicle has unique or modified lights, just let us know in advance."
    icon: mdi:shield-check-outline

  - label: "How long does headlight restoration take?"
    content: "Most restorations take around 45–60 minutes depending on the level of oxidation and lens condition. Heavier damage may take a little longer, with time billed fairly in 30-minute increments."
    icon: mdi:timer-outline

  - label: "Do I need to be present during the service?"
    content: "Not unless you’d like to be. You can leave instructions for access and we’ll take care of the rest. Once complete, you’ll receive before-and-after photos so you can review the results remotely."
    icon: mdi:account-off-outline

  - label: "How long do the results last?"
    content: "Thanks to the UV sealant applied during the process, your headlights will stay clearer for much longer than with a basic polish. Regular washing and parking out of direct sun will also help prolong the finish."
    icon: mdi:weather-sunny-alert

  - label: "Where can the restoration be carried out?"
    content: "We come to you — at home, at work, or any location with safe access around the vehicle. A flat, private parking space or driveway is ideal. We don’t operate on public roads or tight spaces."
    icon: mdi:map-marker-radius-outline

  - label: "How is it priced?"
    content: "You’ll receive a fixed quote when booking, based on your vehicle and location. Payment is taken on the day of service, and any extra time needed is billed in 30-minute increments with full transparency."
    icon: mdi:receipt-text-outline

  - label: "Can I bundle this with other services?"
    content: "Yes — headlight restoration can be added to other car care services like exterior washes, full valets, or engine bay cleaning. Just select your extras during booking or let us know what you need."

Book headlight restoration{{$doc.location}} for a safer drive

#description
Cloudy or dull headlights don't just affect how your car looks — they also reduce visibility and safety at night. With BaseLink, you can book professional headlight restoration{{$doc.location}} that's carried out by trusted local specialists, right on your driveway or at your workplace.

#description
The service begins with a full inspection of your headlight lenses to assess their condition. After that, the surface is cleaned to remove dirt and debris before wet sanding begins to lift oxidation and surface damage.

#description
Your technician will then polish the headlights to restore clarity, removing haze and yellowing for a fresher, brighter finish. A UV sealant is applied to protect against future fading and sun damage, helping the results last longer.

#description
Finally, the lenses are buffed and wiped down to a clear, even shine. The difference is immediate — better visibility, improved appearance, and no need to replace the units.

#description
Booking is fast and simple through the BaseLink platform. Just fill out the online form, get an instant quote, and select a time and place that suits you. No garage visits or waiting around.

#description

#description
Payment is taken on the day of the job, with any additional time billed fairly in 30-minute increments. You can also request add-ons or bundle with other vehicle services if needed.
