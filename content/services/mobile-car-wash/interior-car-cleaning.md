The service covers all key areas inside your vehicle. Interior windows are cleaned for a streak-free finish, and door shuts and sills are wiped down to remove built-up dust and dirt. Seats, boot space, and floor mats are thoroughly vacuumed to lift crumbs, debris and pet hair.

Dashboards, consoles and interior plastics are cleaned and dusted, including smaller areas like cup holders, compartments and air vents. These often-overlooked details make a big difference to how your cabin looks and feels.

To finish, your technician applies a light deodorising treatment to refresh the space and remove any lingering odours. Every clean ends with a full inspection to make sure your vehicle’s interior looks and smells its best.
