Book car odour removal{{$doc.location}} to eliminate smells

#description
Unpleasant smells can linger in a car long after the source is gone. With BaseLink, you can book trusted local specialists for professional car odour removal{{$doc.location}} — delivered at your home, workplace or wherever your vehicle is parked.

#description
The service begins with an inspection to identify the source of the odour. From food spills to smoke, damp or pet smells, your technician will assess the affected areas before starting treatment.

#description
Professional-grade neutralisers are applied to break down and eliminate odours at the source. For more persistent smells, ozone or fogging treatments are used to penetrate deep into fabrics, vents and hard-to-reach spaces.

#description
Your technician will also clean and refresh air vents, wipe down surfaces, and apply a deodorising treatment to leave the interior smelling clean and neutral. The goal is not to mask the smell — but to remove it entirely.

#description
Booking through BaseLink is simple. Just fill out our online form, receive an instant quote, and select a time that works for you. Everything is handled digitally, so there's no back-and-forth or delays.

#description
All service providers on our platform are vetted, reviewed and supported by our in-house team. You can add special instructions or combine odour removal with other interior services if needed.

#description
Payment is collected on the day of the job, with any additional time billed in 30-minute increments. You stay in control, with clear pricing and reliable results every time.
