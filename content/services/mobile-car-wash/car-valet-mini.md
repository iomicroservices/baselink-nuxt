    icon: mdi:timer-outline

  - label: "Can I customise the mini valet?"
    content: "Absolutely. You can add extra services or leave special instructions during booking — whether it’s extra focus on the wheels, stubborn pet hair, or interior touch-ups. Just let us know and we’ll tailor the service to your needs."
    icon: mdi:clipboard-edit-outline

  - label: "Where can you carry out the valet?"

  - label: "Do I need to be there during the valet?"
    content: "Not unless you want to be. You can leave access instructions during booking and we’ll take care of the rest. We’ll send before-and-after photos once the clean is complete, so you can review it remotely."

  - label: "What do I need to provide?"
    content: "Nothing at all. Our team brings all necessary equipment, products, and water supply if needed. Just let us know during booking if access to power or water is restricted, and we’ll adjust accordingly."
