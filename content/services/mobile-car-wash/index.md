faqs:
  - label: "Where can I have my car washed?"
    content: "Anywhere thatâ€™s convenient â€” at home, work, or even while youâ€™re out. Just make sure the vehicle is parked safely and legally in a space thatâ€™s off the main road, with enough room for our team to work around it. We canâ€™t operate on busy high streets or public roads, but driveways, car parks, and quieter side streets are usually perfect."

  - label: "Do I need to be present during the car wash?"
    content: "Nope! Youâ€™re welcome to be there, but it's not required. You can leave access instructions when booking â€” like where the keys will be or how to access a gated area. Weâ€™ll handle the clean and let you know once itâ€™s done. The cleaning team will take photos of the vehicle before and after the clean which youâ€™ll be able to review remotely."
    icon: mdi:account-off-outline

  - label: "What types of car cleaning services do you offer?"
    content: "We offer a full range â€” from quick exterior washes and interior mini valets to full valets, engine bay cleaning, rim refurbishment, odour removal, and more. You can choose exactly what your car needs through our quote form and submit any additional requirements."
    icon: mdi:car-wash

  - label: "Do you clean electric or hybrid vehicles?"
    content: "Yes! Our mobile car wash pros are trained to safely clean all types of vehicles, including electric and hybrid models. If your vehicle has specific needs, just let us know when booking."
    icon: mdi:ev-plug-type2

  - label: "What do I need to provide?"
    content: "Nothing at all â€” our cleaning partners bring everything they need, including water and power if required. If access to either is restricted, just mention it during booking and weâ€™ll adapt accordingly."
    icon: mdi:toolbox-outline

  - label: "How do I book a mobile car wash?"
    content: "Just fill out our quick online form. Youâ€™ll get an instant quote based on your car type and chosen services. Pick a date, time, and location â€” and weâ€™ll take care of the rest."
    icon: mdi:calendar-check-outline

  - label: "Can I book on short notice?"
    content: "Yes! We offer same-day and next-day slots depending on availability in your area. Weâ€™ll always try to match you with a local cleaner as soon as possible."
    icon: mdi:clock-fast

  - label: "Do you offer regular car cleaning plans?"
    content: "We do! You can set up a regular cleaning schedule â€” weekly, fortnightly or monthly â€” right from your account. Just choose your preferred services and timings, and weâ€™ll keep your car fresh on repeat."
    icon: mdi:repeat

  - label: "How do I pay?"
    content: "Youâ€™ll receive a fixed quote when you book based on the services you choose â€” no surprises. We will collect a payment method when you book but payment is only taken on the day of your clean. You can also add multiple services, like a full valet plus rim refurbishment, and see everything itemised before confirming."
    icon: mdi:credit-card-outline

  - label: "What if I need to cancel or reschedule?"
    content: "No problem â€” you can make changes up to 24 hours in advance at no extra cost. Just log into your account or contact our support team and weâ€™ll get it sorted."
    icon: mdi:calendar-remove-outline

  - label: "Are your car cleaners vetted and insured?"
    content: "Yes â€” all mobile car wash providers on BaseLink are fully insured, background-checked, and reviewed by real customers. Youâ€™ll always get a professional who takes pride in their work."
    icon: mdi:shield-check-outline

  - label: "Can you clean my car in bad weather?"
    content: "Light rain is usually fine, but heavy rain or extreme weather might affect your booking unless you can provide a shielded location for the clean (e.g. a garage). If we need to reschedule, weâ€™ll let you know and arrange a new time that suits you."
