Book car rim refurbishment{{$doc.location}} to restore scuffed or damaged wheels

#description
Damaged alloys can spoil the look of your entire vehicle — but a full replacement isn't always necessary. With BaseLink, you can book expert car rim refurbishment{{$doc.location}} carried out by skilled local professionals, right at your home or workplace.

#description
The service begins with a full visual inspection to assess kerb damage, corrosion, chips or scratches. Your technician will then strip and clean the affected wheel to prepare the surface for repair.

#description
Using precision sanding, grinding and filler, scuffs and imperfections are smoothed out. The rim is then primed, resprayed in a colour that matches your original finish, and sealed with a protective clear coat for long-term durability.

#description
To complete the job, your technician will polish the rim and carry out a quality check to ensure a flawless result. You can also request custom colours or finishes if you want a fresh look beyond simple restoration.

#description
Everything is managed digitally through BaseLink. You can submit your job online, receive an instant quote, and book a time that works for you — no need to visit a garage or wait days for a return.

#description
All rim repair providers on BaseLink are fully vetted, reviewed by other customers, and supported by our in-house team. You can add extra services or instructions at checkout for a fully personalised experience.

#description
Payment is taken on the day of service, with any additional time charged fairly in 30-minute increments. You get full transparency, quality work, and the convenience of mobile service — all in one place.
