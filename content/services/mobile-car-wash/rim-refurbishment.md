  - label: "What types of damage can you fix?"
    content: "We can repair kerb scuffs, chips, light scratches, corrosion, and general surface damage. If your alloy rims are dented or severely cracked, we may recommend a specialist repair or replacement instead."
    icon: mdi:alert-circle-outline

  - label: "Do you match the original wheel colour?"
    content: "Yes — we colour-match your existing finish as closely as possible. If you’d like a different look, you can also request a custom colour or finish during booking, including matte, gloss, or gunmetal."
    icon: mdi:palette-swatch

  - label: "How long does rim refurbishment take?"
    content: "Most refurbishments take 1.5 to 2 hours per wheel, depending on the level of damage. If additional work is needed, we’ll let you know in advance and bill fairly in 30-minute increments."
    icon: mdi:timer-outline

  - label: "Where can the service be carried out?"
    content: "We can refurbish your rims at home, work, or any private location with safe space to work around the wheels. Driveways or private car parks are ideal. We can’t work on public roads or busy roadside spaces."
    icon: mdi:map-marker-radius-outline

  - label: "Is this suitable for all wheel types?"
    content: "Yes — we service most alloy and painted wheels. If your wheels are diamond cut or highly specialised, let us know in advance as the process may differ or require alternative treatments."
    icon: mdi:car-cog

  - label: "Can I drive immediately after the service?"
    content: "Yes — but we recommend avoiding car washes or abrasive cleaning for at least 48 hours to allow the finish to fully cure. Your technician will advise on any aftercare steps."
