Whether you’re setting up a home cinema, upgrading your living room, or fitting out a commercial space, BaseLink makes it easy to install your sound system properly. We connect you with experienced network engineers{{$doc.location}} who can mount, wire, and configure your audio for optimal performance.

We install all types of speaker systems — ceiling-mounted, wall-mounted, bookshelf, and soundbars — ensuring clean cable routing, secure fittings, and seamless connection to your AV receiver or smart hub.

#description
You can supply your own equipment, or let us provide a system that fits your layout and preferences. We’ll install and configure everything to suit your room size, acoustics, and usage — whether it’s surround sound for movie nights or background audio throughout your property.

For multi-room audio, we connect and sync your speakers so you can stream music or announcements across zones, either from a central hub or via your smartphone app.

#description
Your engineer will also test, balance and calibrate the sound to make sure it’s crisp and evenly distributed — no dead zones, no overpowering bass, just quality sound in all the right places.

Booking through BaseLink is quick and fully online. Just submit your request, get an instant quote, and choose a time that works for you. Our in-house team is always on hand to help with any special setup notes or post-install support.
