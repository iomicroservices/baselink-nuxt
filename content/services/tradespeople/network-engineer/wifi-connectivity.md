Buffering, blackspots and dropped video calls are more than annoying — they’re avoidable. BaseLink connects you with experienced network engineers{{$doc.location}} who install and optimise WiFi systems that actually reach every room, no matter the size or layout of your property.

#description
We assess your space and run signal strength tests to identify weak zones. From there, your engineer will install the right solution — whether that’s repositioning your router, adding mesh access points, or running wired cabling for ultra-stable performance.

We set up and configure routers, mesh systems, or wireless extenders depending on your needs. Your engineer will also help connect your devices, test speed across zones, and offer tips to keep your network running smoothly.

#description
This service is ideal for homes, offices, and rental properties where WiFi just isn’t cutting it — and we’ll work around your walls, floors and layout to deliver the best possible results.

#description
