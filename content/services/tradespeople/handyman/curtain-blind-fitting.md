  - label: "Do you install curtain poles and blind brackets?"

  - label: "Do I need to supply the curtain pole or blind?"
    content: "Yes – you’ll need to provide the curtain pole, track, or blind you'd like fitted. If you’re not sure what’s suitable, we can advise you based on your window and wall type."

  - label: "Do you fit child safety fixings for blinds?"
    content: "Yes – we install cord or chain safety clips to meet current safety standards. If your blinds include a chain or loop, we’ll secure it safely out of reach of children."
