Book cabinet and shelf fitting{{$doc.location}} that really hold up

#description
Need extra storage or want to upgrade your interiors? BaseLink connects you with trusted local handypeople{{$doc.location}} who can fit cabinets, shelves, and storage units with precision. Whether it’s a hallway cabinet, floating shelves in the living room, or bathroom storage, we’ll make sure everything’s installed safely and looks great.

#description
Your handyperson will assess the wall type — whether plasterboard, brick or tile — and choose the right fixings to ensure a stable and long-lasting result. Wall plugs, screws, and brackets are fitted securely, with everything aligned and levelled for a clean, balanced finish.

#description
We can assemble flat-pack shelving and cabinets as part of the visit, or install pre-assembled units you already have. Floating shelves, corner racks, and wall-mounted cupboards are all handled with care, and safety is always prioritised — especially for high-mounted or heavy items.

#description
If your unit includes handles, hinges or soft-close doors, your handyperson will fit and adjust them to work smoothly. At the end of the job, they’ll check stability, clear up the workspace and make sure everything is working as expected.
