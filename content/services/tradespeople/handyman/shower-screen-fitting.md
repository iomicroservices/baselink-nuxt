Book shower screen fitting{{$doc.location}} for splash-proof installs

#description
A poorly fitted shower screen can lead to leaks, wobbles, and water where you don't want it. With BaseLink, you can book experienced handypeople{{$doc.location}} to install hinged, sliding, or fixed screens neatly and securely — leaving you with a clean, level finish and a watertight seal.

#description
Your fitter will begin by measuring and marking out the wall to ensure precise positioning. Brackets or channels are drilled and mounted securely, and your screen is aligned and fitted for stability and function — whether it opens or stays fixed.

#description
We seal the edges with quality silicone to prevent drips, leaks or water damage, and ensure the screen is level, smooth-moving (if hinged or sliding), and properly supported for long-term use.

#description
Screens can be installed in en-suites, over-bath setups or walk-in showers. If you're unsure what type you need, your handyperson can guide you on placement and compatibility with your bathroom layout.

#description
Booking is easy through BaseLink's online platform. Submit your request in minutes, receive an instant quote, and pick a time that works for you — no need to chase trades or deal with unclear pricing.

#description
All fitters are fully vetted, reviewed and experienced in bathroom installations. Every job is backed by our in-house team, and we always tidy up before we leave.

#description
Payment is collected on the day of the job, with additional time billed fairly in 30-minute increments. Book shower screen fitting{{$doc.location}} today with BaseLink — and enjoy a splash-free shower with style and stability built in.
