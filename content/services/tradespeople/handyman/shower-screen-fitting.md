Book shower screen fitting{{$doc.location}} for splash-proof installs

Your fitter will begin by measuring and marking out the wall to ensure precise positioning. Brackets or channels are drilled and mounted securely, and your screen is aligned and fitted for stability and function — whether it opens or stays fixed.
