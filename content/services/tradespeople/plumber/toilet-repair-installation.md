Book toilet repair or installation{{$doc.location}} for fast fixes

#description
Whether your toilet won't stop running, won't flush at all, or you're upgrading to a new unit, BaseLink connects you with skilled local plumbers{{$doc.location}} who can repair or replace your toilet quickly, cleanly, and properly.

#description
For repairs, we diagnose issues like flush malfunctions, leaks around the base, weak water flow or noisy cisterns. Common fixes include replacing fill valves, flush mechanisms, washers, or seals — all done on the spot wherever possible.

#description
If you're installing a new toilet, your plumber will remove the old unit, check the condition of the waste connection and water feed, and fit the new model securely with everything sealed, level and ready to go.

#description
Once fitted, the toilet is tested for leaks and flush strength, and the area is left clean and tidy. You can supply your own unit or we can help source one that suits your bathroom setup.

#description
This service is ideal for urgent fixes, bathroom refurbs or end-of-tenancy property maintenance.
