Book toilet repair or installation{{$doc.location}} for fast fixes

#description
Whether your toilet won’t stop running, won’t flush at all, or you’re upgrading to a new unit, BaseLink connects you with skilled local plumbers{{$doc.location}} who can repair or replace your toilet quickly, cleanly, and properly.

#description
For repairs, we diagnose issues like flush malfunctions, leaks around the base, weak water flow or noisy cisterns. Common fixes include replacing fill valves, flush mechanisms, washers, or seals — all done on the spot wherever possible.

#description
If you're installing a new toilet, your plumber will remove the old unit, check the condition of the waste connection and water feed, and fit the new model securely with everything sealed, level and ready to go.

#description
Once fitted, the toilet is tested for leaks and flush strength, and the area is left clean and tidy. You can supply your own unit or we can help source one that suits your bathroom setup.

#description
This service is ideal for urgent fixes, bathroom refurbs or end-of-tenancy property maintenance.

#description
Booking through BaseLink is simple and online. Just submit your job, get an instant quote, and choose a time that works for you. Our support team manages everything to keep the job on track.

#description
All BaseLink plumbers are vetted, reviewed by customers nearby, and experienced in both domestic and commercial plumbing. Whatever the issue, we’ll help you get things back in working order.

#description
Payment is collected on the day of service, with any additional time billed in fair 30-minute increments. Book toilet repair or installation{{$doc.location}} with BaseLink — and get the job done with no mess and no flush failures.
