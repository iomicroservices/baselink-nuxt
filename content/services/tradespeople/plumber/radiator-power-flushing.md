faqs:
  - label: "What is radiator power flushing?"
    content: "Power flushing is a process that clears sludge, rust, and debris from your central heating system using a specialised machine. It restores radiator performance and helps your boiler run more efficiently."
    icon: mdi:water-pump

  - label: "When should I get a power flush?"
    content: "Common signs include cold spots on radiators, noisy pipes or boiler, slow heating, or dirty water when you bleed your radiators. It's also recommended when installing a new boiler onto an older system."
    icon: mdi:clock-alert-outline

  - label: "How long does power flushing take?"
    content: "Most jobs take between 4–8 hours, depending on the size of your system and how blocked it is. We’ll give you a more accurate estimate when you book."
    icon: mdi:progress-clock

  - label: "Will power flushing fix all radiator issues?"
    content: "It can solve many common issues caused by sludge build-up, but it won’t fix leaks, damaged valves or faulty thermostats. Your plumber will advise if other repairs are needed."
    icon: mdi:alert-circle-outline

  - label: "Do I need to do anything before the visit?"
    content: "Just make sure there’s clear access to your boiler and radiators. If you have a combi boiler or sealed system, make sure the water supply is working — we’ll handle the rest."
    icon: mdi:door-open

  - label: "What’s included in the service?"
    content: "We connect a power flushing machine, clear out your entire system, balance radiators, add corrosion inhibitor, and test for performance. You’ll get full results and advice afterwards."
    icon: mdi:clipboard-check-outline

  - label: "Can you add inhibitor after the flush?"
    content: "Yes — a chemical inhibitor is always added after the flush to prevent future sludge build-up and protect your system long-term."
    icon: mdi:shield-plus-outline

  - label: "Is this safe for all systems?"
    content: "Yes — power flushing is safe for most modern systems. If you have very old radiators or delicate pipework, your plumber will assess whether a gentler method is needed."
    icon: mdi:home-heart

  - label: "Are your plumbers vetted and insured?"
    content: "Yes — all BaseLink plumbers are fully vetted, insured, and reviewed by local customers. You’ll always get a qualified expert who knows how to treat your system with care."

Book radiator power flushing{{$doc.location}} to bring the heat back

#description
If your radiators take forever to warm up or feel cold in patches, it might be time for a power flush. BaseLink connects you with skilled local plumbers{{$doc.location}} who clear out sludge, rust, and debris from your heating system — so everything runs hotter, faster and more efficiently.

#description
Using a professional power flushing machine, your engineer will pump water and cleaning agents through your system to dislodge and remove the build-up that's clogging pipes and radiators. This helps restore full heat flow and protects your boiler from strain.

#description
Each radiator is checked for blockages or cold spots, then balanced for even heat distribution. Once clean, we add a corrosion inhibitor to help prevent future build-up and extend the life of your heating system.

#description
This service can reduce energy bills, cut down on noise, and improve comfort — especially if your radiators haven't been flushed in years or you've just had a new boiler installed.

#description
Booking through BaseLink is simple and fully online. Submit your job request, get an instant quote, and choose a time that works best for you. Our support team will manage the job from start to finish.

#description
All plumbers are vetted, reviewed by local customers, and experienced with both small domestic and larger heating systems. Whether it's a one-off flush or part of wider system maintenance, we'll get it sorted.

#description
Payment is collected on the day of service, with additional time billed in fair 30-minute increments. Book radiator power flushing{{$doc.location}} with BaseLink — and warm up your home, not your frustration.
