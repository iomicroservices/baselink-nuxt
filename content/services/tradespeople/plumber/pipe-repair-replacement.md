Leaky joint? Burst pipe? Time to upgrade ageing plumbing? BaseLink connects you with trusted, local plumbers{{$doc.location}} who quickly diagnose and fix pipework issues — whether it’s a minor drip or a major emergency.

#description
We repair all pipe types, including copper, plastic (PVC/PEX), and older lead or steel systems. Your plumber will identify the damaged area, repair any faulty joints or valves, or fully replace the pipework if needed.

Repairs are carried out with care to minimise disruption, whether inside walls, under sinks or below floors. If an upgrade is required, we’ll swap out outdated or corroded piping for new, durable materials that meet today’s safety and efficiency standards.

#description
Every job includes pressure testing and inspection once complete, ensuring there are no hidden leaks or weak spots left behind.

If you’re dealing with an active leak, we can provide emergency response to shut off the water and prevent further damage — then carry out the repair once the situation is stabilised.
