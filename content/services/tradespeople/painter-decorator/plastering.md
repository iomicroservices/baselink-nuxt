A flawless finish starts with the right base. BaseLink connects you with experienced local decorators{{$doc.location}} who offer expert plastering services — ideal for preparing your walls and ceilings before painting or wallpapering.

#description
We handle everything from patch repairs and skim coats to full room resurfacing. Your decorator will prep the area by cleaning the surface, repairing any damage, and protecting surrounding fixtures and floors.

#description
Plaster is applied in multiple layers — from bonding and base coats to a smooth, skimmed finish. Whether it's an old wall in need of restoration or a brand-new space that needs evening out, we leave surfaces clean, level, and ready to decorate.

#description
We plaster walls, ceilings and smaller problem areas too — like cracks, dents, and corners. You can request work in specific rooms or book as part of a wider decorating project.

#description
After the job is done, we clear away any debris, remove protective sheeting and leave your space clean and ready for drying time.

#description
Booking through BaseLink is easy and digital. Submit your request, receive an instant quote, and choose a time that works for you — with dedicated support throughout your booking.
