Book PAT testing{{$doc.location}} to ensure your appliances are safe and compliant

#description
Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) is essential for ensuring that electrical equipment is safe to use — whether you're a landlord, office manager, or running a business. BaseLink connects you with qualified local engineers{{$doc.location}} who carry out fast, reliable PAT testing across homes, workplaces and rental properties.

#description
The service includes a full visual inspection of each appliance, checking for signs of damage or wear. Plugs and cables are assessed for integrity, and each item is tested for insulation resistance, earth continuity and bonding to confirm it meets safety standards.

#description
Functional checks are also carried out to ensure appliances operate correctly. Each item that passes testing is labelled with a dated tag for compliance, while any faulty items are flagged with clear guidance on next steps.

#description
Once the assessment is complete, you'll receive a full condition report listing all tested items and their results — suitable for audit, insurance, or legal requirements. Whether you're managing a rental property, office, or commercial unit, it helps you demonstrate a safe environment for users.

#description
Booking PAT testing through BaseLink is fast and fully online. Submit your request, receive an instant quote, and choose a time that fits your schedule — with no need to chase availability or wait for callbacks.

#description
All engineers on our platform are qualified, experienced and fully vetted. You'll also have support from our dedicated in-house team in case you need to add appliances, reschedule or book other safety services like EICRs or fire risk assessments.

#description
Payment is collected on the day of testing, and any additional time is billed fairly in 30-minute increments. Book PAT testing{{$doc.location}} today with BaseLink — and make sure your appliances are safe, documented, and up to standard.
