Book an EICR report{{$doc.location}} to ensure electrical safety and compliance

#description
An Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) is essential for landlords, property managers and homeowners to ensure a building's wiring is safe and up to standard. With BaseLink, you can book a qualified local assessor{{$doc.location}} to carry out a professional EICR inspection and issue a full report — quickly and without the hassle.

#description
Your assessor will begin with a visual inspection of the electrical installation, looking for visible signs of damage or deterioration. This is followed by a series of in-depth tests, including checks on earthing, bonding, and circuit integrity to confirm everything is working safely.

#description
Insulation resistance testing and live/dead testing (including RCD testing) are used to assess the performance and reliability of your circuits. Fuses and circuit breakers are tested to ensure proper protection is in place for all parts of the property.

#description
The report also identifies any overloaded circuits, outdated wiring, or fire and electric shock risks. If faults or non-compliant areas are found, your assessor will document them clearly and advise on the necessary steps to fix them.

#description
Once the inspection is complete, you'll receive a full EICR report with clear coding to indicate if remedial work is required. The document is suitable for legal compliance and can be shared with tenants, letting agents or contractors.

#description

#description
